## **Cloning Messenger.com: My First HTML and CSS Project**

"I worked with my tutor to create a clone of the Messenger.com interface using HTML and CSS. We overcame the challenge of making the page responsive with CSS media queries. This project gave me a deeper understanding of web development and was a great learning experience."
