## **Cloning [messenger.com](https://messenger.com): My First HTML and CSS Project**

"I worked with my [tutor](https://www.youtube.com/@MSquareProgramming) to create a clone of the [messenger.com](https://messenger.com) interface using HTML and CSS. We overcame the challenge of making the page responsive with CSS media queries. This project gave me a deeper understanding of web development and was a great learning experience."
